# Hello!

I'm a postdoc affiliated with NYU (with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu/)) and Harvard (with [Fiery Cushman](https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/)). I did my PhD with [Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.princeton.edu) at Princeton.

My research focuses on how human cognition is jointly shaped by the structure of the external world and our internal cognitive capacities. I develop computational models that make detailed predictions about the mental strategies people use across several domains, and test these models using fine-grained process data. My long-term goals are to (1) develop a domain-general computational and empirical framework for understanding the adaptive, algorithmic structure of cognition, (2) apply this framework to develop precise models of the internal and external factors that shape human cognitive processes, and (3) use those models to design interventions that improve people's lives.

My [dissertation](pdfs/callaway-dissertation.pdf), _Cognition as a sequential decision problem_, applied metalevel Markov decision processes to develop optimal algorithmic models of attention, memory, and planning.

Here is a reasonably up-to-date [CV](callaway-cv.pdf).

<!-- ### Research Statement
How do people make decisions

My research attempt to answer this question from the perspective of [resource-rational analysis](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/RationalUseOfCognitiveResources.pdf). Under this approach we identify optimal reasoning strategies 

Intelligent agents must continually respond to and learn from their environment. Mathematical models from Bayesian statistics and reinforcement learning can provide optimal solutions to these problems; but they are often intractable to compute. How do humans find good approximations to these optimal solutions using limited computational resources? In particular, how do they balance the competing goals of learning, deciding, and conserving resources? I aim to study this question with game-based empirical experiments and computational models inspired by machine learning algorithms. -->
