# About me

I'm a postdoc affiliated with NYU (with [Marcelo Mattar](https://mattarlab.ucsd.edu/)) and Harvard (with [Fiery Cushman](https://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/)). I did my PhD with [Tom Griffiths](http://cocosci.princeton.edu) at Princeton.

I study how people make efficient use of their limited cognitive resources, with an emphasis on sequential decision making.

My [dissertation](dissertation.pdf), _Cognition as a sequential decision problem_ applied metalevel Markov decision processes to develop optimal algorithmic models of attention, memory, and planning.

Here is a reasonably up-to-date [CV](callaway-cv.pdf).

<!-- ### Research Statement
How do people make decisions

My research attempt to answer this question from the perspective of [resource-rational analysis](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/RationalUseOfCognitiveResources.pdf). Under this approach we identify optimal reasoning strategies 

Intelligent agents must continually respond to and learn from their environment. Mathematical models from Bayesian statistics and reinforcement learning can provide optimal solutions to these problems; but they are often intractable to compute. How do humans find good approximations to these optimal solutions using limited computational resources? In particular, how do they balance the competing goals of learning, deciding, and conserving resources? I aim to study this question with game-based empirical experiments and computational models inspired by machine learning algorithms. -->
