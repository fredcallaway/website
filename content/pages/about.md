I'm a first year Psychology PhD student at UC Berkeley. I work in Tom Griffiths' [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu). I received my B.A. in Psychology and Linguistics from Cornell University under the advising of [Shimon Edelman](http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/). You can check out my work from the links in my slightly out-of-date [resume]({filename}/pdfs/fred-callaway.pdf).

## Research Statement
Intelligent agents must continually respond to and learn from their environment. Mathematical models from Bayesian statistics and reinforcement learning can provide optimal solutions to these problems; but they are often intractable to compute. How do humans find good approximations to these optimal solutions using limited neural resources? In particular, how do they balance the competing goals of learning, deciding, and conserving resources? I aim to study this question with game-based empirical experiments and computational models inspired by machine learning algorithms.
