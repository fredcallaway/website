I'm a first year PhD student at UC Berkeley, working in Tom Griffiths' [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu). I received my B.A. in Psychology from Cornell University, under the advising of [Shimon Edelman](http://kybele.psych.cornell.edu/~edelman/). You can check out my work from the links in my slightly out-of-date [resume]({filename}/pdfs/fred-callaway.pdf).

## Research Interests

- Reinforcement learning
- Structure and category learning
- Bounded optimality
